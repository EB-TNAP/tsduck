TSDuck Change Log and Release Notes
===================================

Version 3.5

- With tstables and plugin tables, it is possible to specify several formats
  at the same time. For instance, it is possible to save tables in text and
  binary format at the same time.

- For programmers, the TSDuck library API was extensively modified. All usage
  of 8-bit strings (char* and std::string) has been removed and replaced by
  Java-like Unicode strings (ts::UString). Many interface have been updated.
  The utilities in tsStringUtils have been removed. Equivalent services exist
  in class ts::UString. All of this break the backward compatibility of user
  code. This is unfortunate but TSDuck code is now more robust and faster to
  maintain.

Version 3.4-20171110

- TSDuck now fully handles DVB character sets in signalization. All textual
  display (tsanalyze, tstables, etc.) are produced in UTF-8 format, with
  characters properly translated from DVB character encoding. The table
  compiler, tstabcomp, properly translates from UTF-8 XML files to DVB
  character encoding and vice versa.

- Added options --default-charset and --europe to tspsi, tstables, tstabdump,
  tstabcomp, plugin psi and plugin tables.

- Added t2mi plugin to extract encapsulated TS packets from T2-MI streams
  (DVB-T2 Modulator Interface).

- T2-MI PID's and PLP's are now included in the report from tsanalyze and the
  plugin analyze.

- Improved robustness of DVB tuner detection on Windows. It solves some issues
  with 32-bit tuner filters on 64-bit systems. But older systems, before
  Windows 7 (XP, Vista, etc.), may no longer work. No support will be provided
  for pre-7 Windows systems.

- Added --test option to tslsdvb on Windows.

Version 3.3-20170930

- Added option --default-pds to tspsi, tstables, tstabdump, plugin psi
  and plugin tables.

- Added option --interval to plugin count.

- Fixed timer issues on Linux, typically seen in plugin regulate.

- Removed command tsgentab and associated plugins. This command is now
  obsolete and has been superseded by the more general tstabcomp, the
  PSI/SI table compiler.

Version 3.3-20170915

- Added command tstabcomp, the PSI/SI table compiler from/to XML files.
  The command tsgentab is now deprecated and will be removed in some
  future version.

Version 3.2-20170911

- Added option --pid to plugin descrambler.

- Improved robustness of option --poll-file ('inject' plugin). Mitigate
  possible race condition when the plugin tries to open a section file
  while it is created/copied by the user. Now retry later.

- Improved robustness of DVB tuner reception on Windows. Explicitly
  resynchronizes on valid packets when the driver misses data.

- Adjusted output of tslsdvb on Windows to better identify tuner names.

- Integrated Dektec DTAPI v5.27.0.97 (Dektec SDK v2017.08.0) on pre-built
  binaries for Windows and Linux.

Version 3.2-20170528

- Added option --poll-file to inject plugin.

- Bug fix: In tstables and tables plugin, the option --max-tables was not
  accurate when several small tables (eg. EMM's) were packed in the same
  TS packet. This is fixed.

Version 3.2-20170525

- Added the development environment in the Windows Installer. This is used to
  develop third-party applications using the TSDuck library. On Ubuntu, added
  the tsduck-dev package. On RPM-based distros, the tsduck-devel package
  already existed.

- Added option --no-duplicate to tstables and tables plugin.

- Added TSPLUGINS_PATH environment variable to use tsp and tsgentab plugins
  outside the directory of the TSDuck executables.
