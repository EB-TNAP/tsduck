This directory contains a complete sample third-party TSDuck extension.

This extension illustrates all possibilities to add the handling of a
third-party table named "Sample Third-Party Table" or STPT. There is
an extension library to manipulate the table, a tsp plugin to manipulate
an STPT on the fly and a utility to do nothing (just to illustrate how
to do that).
