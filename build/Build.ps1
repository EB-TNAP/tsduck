 .SYNOPSIS

  Build TSDuck from the command line, an alternative to Visual Studio.

 .PARAMETER Debug

  Generate the debug version of the binaries. If neither -Release nor -Debug
  is specified, the release version is built by default.

 .PARAMETER Release

  Generate the release version of the binaries. If neither -Release nor -Debug
  is specified, the release version is built by default.

 .PARAMETER Win32

  Generate the 32-bit version of the binaries. If neither -Win32 nor -Win64
  is specified, both versions are built by default.

 .PARAMETER Win64

  is specified, both versions are built by default.

 .PARAMETER NoPause

  Do not wait for the user to press <enter> at end of execution. By default,
  execute a "pause" instruction at the end of execution, which is useful
  when the script was run from Windows Explorer.
