=== Hardware support

This section describes some specificities of the various types of hardware devices
which are supported by TSDuck and their impact on the code.

The TSDuck User's Guide has a complete chapter on each of these classes of devices.
It describes the devices, their naming, usage, supported platforms, required drivers, etc.
In the Developer's Guide, we focus on the structure of the code, for TSDuck maintainers.

==== Standard tuner receiver devices (DVB, ATSC, ISDB)

The code for tuners is located in `src/libtsduck/dtv/broadcast`.

The base class for all tuners is `TunerBase`.
It exposes the common interface of all tuners.
It is normally never directly used by an application.

A tuner is accessed by an application using the subclass `Tuner`.

When opening a `Tuner` instance, depending on the provided name, the tuner is either
a physical device or a software emulator.
The `Tuner` instance creates either an internal `TunerDevice` object or an internal
`TunerEmulator` object. These two classes are also subclasses of `TunerBase`.
Once a `Tuner` is opened, all services are redirected to the internal `TunerDevice`
or `TunerEmulator` object.

The subclass `TunerEmulator` is a pure software implementation which is available
on all systems. The name of such a device in a XML file which describes all the
capabilities of the "tuner" and the available frequencies and corresponding
modulation parameters. The TSDuck User's Guide describes the tuner emulator in details.

The `TunerDevice` class is highly dependent on the operating system.
The source files are different and placed in system-specific directories.
The subdirectories `linux` and `windows` contain actual implementations
for these operating systems. The subdirectories `mac` and `bsd` contain
stub versions which report errors when used.

[.usage]
Linux

The Linux implementation is relatively straightforward using the Linux TV API.
This API evolves on a regular basis. New modulations are added.

It is sometimes useful to review the evolutions of the Linux TV API to detect
new modulations and new parameters. In the `broadcast/linux` subdirectory, there is a
Bash script named `get-linux-tv-api-history.sh` which extracts from the Linux
kernel repository a snapshot of each new version of the Linux TV, with a
`diff` file of each version.

[.usage]
Windows

The Windows implementation is more problematic. The tuner devices are managed by DirectShow,
a Microsoft framework for multimedia. The specific subsystem of DirectShow for TV receiver
devices is BDA (Broadcast Device Architecture). Most of the time, the hardware vendors
provide BDA drivers for their receivers. Windows does not include any predefined BDA driver.

The DirectShow framework is complex. It is based on the concept of "graphs of filters".
Each DirectShow filter is a COM object which exposes standard interfaces. Media processing
starts with building a graph with filters, and connecting these filters together using
the standard interfaces they expose.

Unlike Linux, there is no standard interface to the various BDA drivers. Each vendor
defines its own interface. A vendor also provides its own DirectShow filters, typically
a "Tuner Filter" and an optional "Receiver / Capture Filter". The proprietary tuner
filter communicates with the proprietary BDA driver. An application can only use the
standard interface of the DirectShow filters.

However, a filter cannot be used alone. It must be part of a DirectShow graph. This graph
must be complete and consistent, with no dangling interface. This is the condition to
"start the graph". Starting the graph is required to read incoming packets from the
tuner.

To make things worse, there is no single way to build a tuner reception graph. It depends
on the proprietary filters. Do they include a receiver / capture filter for instance?
Some combinations of filters work, some others don't. Depending on the tuner device,
various types of graphs shall be used, or different filters of the same types.

When building a graph, the application "connects" filters together, by pairs.
A filter can accept or reject the connection. Therefore, in the absence of deterministic
method, TSDuck uses a flexible approach. Several "standard" types of graphs are tested.
At each node of the graph, we search all available filters of the required type for
that node. Normally, only one combination of filters can be built, with all connections
being accepted by all filters. This is the method which is used by TSDuck, testing all
possible graphs for the tuner until one is accepted.

This looks complicated (and it is) but the standard use case for a tuner on Windows
is simpler. When you purchase a tuner, it comes with all software: BDA driver,
DirectShow filters, and TV watching application. Since the application is provided
by the tuner vendor, for that tuner, there is only one way to build a graph for that
tuner and it is well known by the tuner vendor. With TSDuck, we have a less common
use case. The application is the same for all tuners and expects to uniformly read the
transport stream from all of them. Simple on Linux, awfully complex on Windows.

Another annoying property of DirectShow is the absence of data output filter.
A DirectShow graph is designed to process media. Typically, it reads media from
somewhere (a tuner in our case), processes them, filters them, and outputs the
result on screen. In short, DirectShow is designed to watch TV...
There is no way to do such a simple thing as reading TS packets from the tuner
device. Therefore, we were obliged to develop our own DirectShow filter. This
filter is inserted in the graph and collects the TS packets using the DirectShow
standard interfaces. This custom DirectShow filter is implemented in the class
`SinkFilter`, with its source code in the `broadcast/windows` subdirectory.

Because everything is annoying in DirectShow, it uses a "push" model. This means
that, once the graph is started, packets are pushed from the tuner all along the
graph. The applications which needs packets, on the contrary, have a "pull" model.
When packets are needed, it "reads" packets, like reading packets on the network,
reading data from a pipe, etc. Therefore, the passing mechanism is asynchronous.
When incoming TS packets are pushed up to our `SinkFilter`, the filter passes them
through a message queue. The application, on the other hand, consumes packets in
pull mode from the message queue. This is performed in the Windows version of the
`TunerDevice` class.

Because everything is _really_ annoying in DirectShow, there are other constraints.
For instance, a tuner reception graph cannot work without a demux filter. In our
case, we don't demux anything because TSDuck wants the complete transport stream.
Anyway, DirectShow needs it or you won't get any packet. Additionally, even though
it would be logical to insert the demux in the middle of the data flow, DirectShow
wants it in a dead-end branch of the graph. Don't try to understand... To paraphrase
a well-known cryptographer, it seems that DirectShow has been "designed by the
E-commerce Department of the Ministry of Silly Walks".

The following diagram represents a typical DirectShow reception graph for a tuner.
It helps understanding the code. Given the complexity of this code, it is not
recommended to modify it, unless completely and absolutely necessary.

As a Grande Finale, let's note that DirectShow received no update, no improvement,
no new features, for years. It looks like abandonware, without any new alternative.
Recent modulations are not supported on Windows and will probably   never be.

In short, if you want to receive broadcast transport streams from a tuner, use Linux...

[.usage]
ISDB-T 204-byte packets

The ISDB-T and ISDB-Tb standards have a specific form of 204-byte packets.
In other modulations, the standard 188-byte TS packet is followed by a 16-byte Reed-Solomon
outer forward error correction code. These 16 bytes are not interesting and dropped by the
demodulator. In ISDB-T and ISDB-Tb, the 16-byte trailer is split in two equal parts. The
Reed-Solomon FEC is reduced to 8 bytes, at the end of the trailer. The first 8 bytes of the
trailer contain ISDB information such as modulation layer, frame counters, system identification.
This information can be analyzed by TSDuck, when available. However, neither the Linux TV
nor the Windows DirectShow API's are able to return 204-byte packets. Therefore, it is
not possible to analyze ISDB-T information from the `dvb` plugin.
