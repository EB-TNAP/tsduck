=== Hardware support

This section describes some specificities of the various types of hardware devices
which are supported by TSDuck and their impact on the code.

The TSDuck User's Guide has a complete chapter on each of these classes of devices.
It describes the devices, their naming, usage, supported platforms, required drivers, etc.
In the Developer's Guide, we focus on the structure of the code, for TSDuck maintainers.

==== Standard tuner receiver devices (DVB, ATSC, ISDB)

The code for tuners is located in `libtsduck/dtv/broadcast`.

===== Code structure

The base class for all tuners is `TunerBase`.
It exposes the common interface of all tuners.
It is normally never directly used by an application.

A tuner is accessed by an application using the subclass `Tuner`.

When opening a `Tuner` instance, depending on the provided name, the tuner is either
a physical device or a software emulator.
The `Tuner` instance creates either an internal `TunerDevice` object or `TunerEmulator`
object. These two classes are also subclasses of `TunerBase`.
Once a `Tuner` is opened, all services are redirected to the internal `TunerDevice`
or `TunerEmulator` object.

The subclass `TunerEmulator` is a pure software implementation which is available
on all systems. The name of such a device in a XML file which describes all the
capabilities of the "tuner" and the available frequencies and corresponding
modulation parameters. The content of the transport stream on each of these
"frequencies" are TS files. These TS files are referenced in the XML file.
Receiving from such a frequency means reading the corresponding TS file,
looping back the beginning when the end of file is reached.

The `TunerDevice` class is highly dependent on the operating system.
The source files are different and placed in system-specific directories.
The subdirectories `linux` and `windows` contain actual implementations
for these operating systems. The subdirectories `mac` and `bsd` contain
stub versions which report errors when used.

===== Windows implementation
