[.cmd-header]
Trigger actions on selected TS packets

This plugin triggers an action (running an external command, sending an UDP packet)
each time a TS packet is marked with a given label.
Labels are typically set on packets by a previous plugin in the chain, such as the `filter` plugin.

By default, without option `--label`, `--start` or `--stop`, the actions are triggered on all packets in the stream.
To avoid "avalanche effects" of too many triggers, the options `--min-inter-packet` and `--min-inter-time` can be used.

[.usage]
Options

[.opt]
*-a* +
*--all-labels*

[.optdoc]
All labels from options `--label` shall be set on a packet to be selected (logical _and_).

[.optdoc]
By default, a packet is selected if any label is set (logical _or_).

[.opt]
*-e* _'command'_ +
*--execute* _'command'_

[.optdoc]
Run the specified command when the current packet triggers the actions.

[.opt]
*-l* _label1[-label2]_ +
*--label* _label1[-label2]_

[.optdoc]
Trigger the actions on packets with any of the specified labels.
Labels should have typically be set by a previous plugin in the chain.

[.optdoc]
Several `--label` options may be specified.

[.optdoc]
Note that the option `--label` is different from the generic option `--only-label`.
The generic option `--only-label` acts at `tsp` level and controls which packets are passed to the plugin.
All other packets are directly passed to the next plugin without going through this plugin.
The option `--label`, on the other hand, is specific to the trigger plugin and
selects packets with specific labels among the packets which are passed to this plugin.

[.opt]
*--local-address* _address_

[.optdoc]
With `--udp`, when the destination is a multicast address, specify the IP address of the outgoing local interface.
It can be also a host name that translates to a local address.

[.opt]
*--min-inter-packet* _count_

[.optdoc]
Specify the minimum number of packets between two triggered actions.

[.optdoc]
Actions which should be triggered in the meantime are ignored.

[.opt]
*--min-inter-time* _milliseconds_

[.optdoc]
Specify the minimum time, in milliseconds, between two triggered actions.

[.optdoc]
Actions which should be triggered in the meantime are ignored.

[.opt]
*--start*

[.optdoc]
Trigger the actions on `tsp` start.

[.opt]
*--stop*

[.optdoc]
Trigger the actions on `tsp` stop.

[.opt]
*--ttl* _value_

[.optdoc]
With `--udp`, specifies the TTL (Time-To-Live) socket option.
The actual option is either "Unicast TTL" or "Multicast TTL", depending on the destination address.
Remember that the default Multicast TTL is 1 on most systems.

[.opt]
*-u* _address:port_ +
*--udp* _address:port_

[.optdoc]
Send a UDP/IP message to the specified destination when the current packet triggers the actions.
The _address_ specifies an IP address which can be either unicast or multicast.
It can be also a host name that translates to an IP address.
The _port_ specifies the destination UDP port.

[.opt]
*--udp-message* _hexa-string_

[.optdoc]
With `--udp`, specifies the binary message to send as UDP datagram.
The value must be a string of hexadecimal digits specifying any number of bytes.
