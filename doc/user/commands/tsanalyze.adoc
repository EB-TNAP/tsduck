[.cmd-header]
Transport stream analysis

This utility analyzes a transport stream.
It reports either a full analysis of the transport stream, services and PID’s
(either in human readable format or normalized format for automatic analysis) or selected individual information.

The output can include full synthetic analysis (options `--\*-analysis`),
full normalized output (options `--normalized` and `--json`)
or a simple list of values on one line (options `--*-list`).
The second and third type of options are useful to write automated scripts.

If output control options are specified, only the selected outputs are produced.
If no such option is given, the default is:

[source, shell]
----
$ tsanalyze --ts-analysis --service-analysis --pid-analysis --table-analysis
----

See also the plugin `analyze` for `tsp` for the equivalent tool in the context of `tsp`.
This plugin analyzes the stream at a specific point in a TS processing pipeline.

[.usage]
Usage

[source,shell]
----
$ tsanalyze [options] [input-file]
----

[.usage]
Input file

[.optdoc]
MPEG transport stream, either a capture file or a pipe from a live stream (see option `--format` for binary formats).

[.optdoc]
If the parameter is omitted, is an empty string or a dash (`-`), the standard input is used.

[.usage]
General purpose options

[.opt]
*-b* _value_ +
*--bitrate* _value_

[.optdoc]
Specifies the bitrate of the transport stream in bits/second (based on 188-byte packets).
By default, the bitrate is evaluated using the PCR in the transport stream.
If no bitrate can be determined (no user-specified value, no PCR),
the analysis will not report the bitrates of the individual services and PID’s.

[.optdoc]
See xref:bitrates[xrefstyle=short] for more details on the representation of bitrates.

[#normalized-analyze]
[.usage]
Normalized output format

In normalized output, each line describes one _object_ (service, PID, table, etc).
The format of each line is:

[source,text]
----
type:name[=value]:...
----

The _type_ identifies the kind of object which is described by the line.
The _name_ identifies a characteristics for the object with an optional value.
There is no space characters.
All integer values are in decimal format.

The normalized syntax can be used to search for specific objects with specific characteristics.
It is specially designed to extract values using standard UNIX tools such as `sed` and `grep`.

*Example*: The following sample command extracts the list of EMM PID’s for the SafeAccess CAS.
The object _type_ is `pid` (at the beginning of line) and the two selected characteristics are `emm` (no value) and
`cas` with SafeAccess DVB-assigned CA_system_id value (0x4ADC, which is 19164 in decimal).

[source,shell]
----
$ tsanalyze --normalize ... | \
    grep '^pid:' | grep ':emm:' | grep ':cas=19164:' | \
    sed -e 's/.*:pid=//' -e 's/:.*//'
----

Other more complex examples of automated scripts are available in xref:chap-examples[xrefstyle=short].

*Obsolescence*: Note that this format was designed in the early times of TSDuck.
Nowadays, more modern formats such as JSON are more appropriate.
The option `--json` can be used instead of `--normalized` to produce a JSON report.
Such an output is easily manipulated and explored using the open source tool `jq`.
