## Doxygen documentation

This directory contains the files and scripts to generate the programming
reference documentation, using doxygen, from the source files.

The CSS files are extracted from "Doxygen Awesome", an open-source project
using the MIT license at https://jothepro.github.io/doxygen-awesome-css/

The shell script `build-doxygen.sh` (Linux, macOS) and the PowerShell script
`build-doxygen.ps1` (Windows) generate the TSDuck Programming Reference
using Doxygen.
