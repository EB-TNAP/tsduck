# TSDuck image files

## TSDuck logo

The TSDuck logo is editable in `tsduck-512.xcf` (GIMP file) with a size of 512x512.
Version of different sizes are exported as `.png` files.

One `.ico` file was exported and is used in resource files on Windows so that
TSDuck executables and DLL's are marked with the TSDuck logo.

The variants named `tsduck-extension` are proposed for TSDuck extension.
This is the same logo as TSDuck to emphasize the relationship with the parent project,
with a Persian Orange variation to outline the independence from TSDuck.

## Color palette in images, documentation and web site

The color palette is rendered in `palette.xcf` (GIMP file) and `palette.png`.

The palette shall be consistently used in the documentation, the diagrams, the web site tsduck.io.
