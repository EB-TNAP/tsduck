==========================================
TSDuck - The MPEG Transport Stream Toolkit
==========================================

Abstract:

  TSDuck provides some simple utilities to process MPEG Transport Streams (TS),
  either as recorded files or live streams. The structure of an MPEG TS is
  defined in ISO 13818-1.

  Through tsp, the Transport Stream Processor, many types of analysis and
  transformation can be applied on live or recorded transport streams.
  This utility can be extended through plugins. Existing plugins can be
  enhanced and new plugins can be developed using a library of C++ classes.

Usage:

  All utilities accept the options --help and --version.
  Using --help, each utility displays its syntax and exits.

Building:

  TSDuck can be built on Windows, Linux and MacOS systems.
  See file src/doc/building.md for details.
