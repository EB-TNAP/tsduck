    //!
    //! Enumerate all 'k'-elements combinations of a 'n'-elements set.
    //!
    //! This function enumerates all possible sets of 'k' elements within
    //! a set of 'n' elements. For each combination, a user-supplied predicate
    //! is invoked. The signature of the predicate function should be equivalent
    //! to the following:
    //!
    //! @code
    //! bool p (const std::set<T>& combination);
    //! @endcode
    //!
    //! The signature does not need to have @c const, but the function must not
    //! modify the set which is passed to it. The function returns true when the
    //! search for more combinations shall continue and false when the search
    //! shall prematurely stops.
    //!
    //! @tparam T The type of elements in the sets.
    //!
    //! @tparam UnaryPredicate The type of unary predicate returning true or false
    //! from one set of elements of type @a T.
    //!
    //! @param values The set of all values from which the combinations are built.
    //! The size of @a values is the 'n' in the sentence <i>"enumerate all 'k'-elements
    //! combinations of a 'n'-elements set"</i>.
    //!
    //! @param fixed The set of fixed values which must be present in all combinations.
    //! To enumerate all possible combinations in @a values, use an empty set for @a fixed.
    //! If @a fixed is not empty, the @a predicate will be invoked only with combinations
    //! of @a values which contains all elements in @a fixed.
    //!
    //! @param size The size (number of elements) of the combinations to enumerate.
    //! This is the 'k' in the sentence <i>"enumerate all 'k'-elements combinations of
    //! a 'n'-elements set"</i>.
    //!
    //! @param predicate The unary predicate to invoke for each possible combination
    //! of @a size elements in @a values. If @a predicate returns true, the search for
    //! more combination continues. When @a predicate returns false, the search is
    //! interrupted immediately and no more combination is proposed.
    //! Example: When the application searches for a combination which matches specific
    //! properties, the application's predicate returns false when a matching combination
    //! is found to avoid looking for additional combinations.
    //!
    //! @return True if all combinations were searched and false if the search was
    //! interrupted because @a predicate returned false at some point.
    //!
