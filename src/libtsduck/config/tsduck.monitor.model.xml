 Template for TSDuck XML configuration files for resource monitoring.

 It is used to validate user-provided XML files. Since TSDuck uses a simple
 XML parser without DTD or XML-Schema support, there is no formal standard
 definition. This file defines the valid structure of an XML file. Tags or
 attributes which are not present here will be rejected. The content of
 nodes and attributes in this file are just informative comments.

 Notes on types and formats:
 - Tags and attributes are not case-sensitive.
 - The names of tags and attributes are copied from ISO or DVB standards.
 - Integer values can be represented in decimal or hexadecimal (0x prefix).
 - Booleans are "true" or "false".
 - Hexa content is a suite of hexa digits. Spaces are ignored.
