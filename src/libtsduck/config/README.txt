This directory contains configuration files which are installed with TSDuck.
These files are constant and should not be modified by the user.

There are three types of configuration files:

- *.names : Names files. They contain names for the thousands of integer
  values which are found in DTB structures.

- *.model.xml : Model files for XML files. A model is an XML document which
  is used to validate another XML document. This is a minimal mechanism, much
  less powerful than XML-Schema, just a cheap alternative.

- *.xml : XML files containing predefined configurations for TSDuck.
